# Pong
My first larger SFML project in which I focused on implementing the state machine (menu, options, game).


12.12.2020
Decided to return to work on that project. I am thinking about:
  - adding some gameplay features like:
    * speed-up/any_other_too bonuses,
    * ability to move in both dimensions (left - right, up, down),
    * obstackles (not only rectangles, but also polygonal figures or even circles).
  - scoreboard,
  - campaign (XD).
